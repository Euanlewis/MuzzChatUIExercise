# MuzzChatUIExercise
This excersice requied me to develop a local Message list Android application which would display the messages between 2 user of the device. 
Requirements of the Exercise:
 - Create a Message list with a Text Entry box.
 - Entered text should appear in the Message List.
 - Distinguish between received and sent messages by aligning them left or right.
 - The messages should be encased in a “bubble”.
 - A message has a tail when any of the following 3 criteria are met:
    1.It is the most recent message in the conversation.
    2.The message after it is sent by the other user.
    3.The message after it was sent more than 20 seconds afterwards.
 - If a previous message was sent more than an hour ago, or there is no previous messages, it should be sectioned as in the screenshots (Thursday 11:59). The format for      this is “{day} {timestamp}”.
 - The app should have some way of being able to trigger messages from the “other” user.
